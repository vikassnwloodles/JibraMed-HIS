GNU Health Surgery Protocols 
############################

The surgery protocols are a set of predefined rules and guidelines that can be used in different
surgical contexts.

Upon entering the surgery protocol in the surgery, many fields will take a default values.

# Anesthesia
# Patient laterality
# Urgency
# Underlying health condition
# Surgery main procedure
# Patient positioning
# Post-operative guidelines
# Discharge instructions

The underlying condition and the main surgical procedure depends on the standard that has been implemented (eg, ICD10, ICD11, ICPM...). In this package, we are using ICD10 for disease coding.
